# AI-ETHICS
# Ethical AI Assignment

This project explores core principles and challenges in developing fair, transparent, and accountable AI systems. It includes theoretical reflections, real-world case analysis, bias auditing using Python and AI Fairness 360, and ethical policy design.

## üß† Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (30%)

- **Short Answer Section**  
  Definitions and examples related to algorithmic bias, transparency vs. explainability, and GDPR implications.

- **Ethical Principles Matching**  
  Matching ethical principles (Justice, Non-maleficence, Autonomy, Sustainability) to their correct definitions.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Part 2: Case Study Analysis (40%)

- **Case 1: Biased Hiring Tool**  
  - Identify bias source (training data/model assumptions).  
  - Propose corrective measures.  
  - Suggest fairness evaluation metrics.

- **Case 2: Facial Recognition in Policing**  
  - Examine ethical risks (e.g., privacy, misidentification).  
  - Recommend responsible AI deployment policies.

## üìä Part 3: Practical Audit (25%)

- **Dataset:** COMPAS Recidivism Dataset  
- **Toolkit:** AI Fairness 360 by IBM  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Analyze racial bias (e.g., disparate false positive rates).  
  - Generate visualizations.  
  - Submit a 300-word bias audit report with remediation steps.

## ‚ú® Part 4: Ethical Reflection (5%)

- Reflect on a personal project and outline strategies for adhering to ethical AI principles (e.g., fairness, user autonomy, and responsible data use).

## üè• Bonus Task: Policy Proposal (Extra 10%)

- Create a 1-page guideline for **ethical AI use in healthcare**, addressing:  
  - Patient consent protocols  
  - Bias mitigation approaches  
  - Transparency requirements

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- IBM AI Fairness 360
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations

## üìÅ Deliverables

- Completed responses for Part 1 & 2 (PDF or DOCX)  
- Python code + visualizations (Jupyter Notebook or .py file)  
- Audit report (Part 3)  
- Ethical reflection (Part 4)  
- Healthcare policy proposal (Bonus Task)
